## Welcome to my portfolio project!!!

I developed this portfolio project using:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- React Email
- Vercel

## Existing Issues

- [ ] Hero animation is very slow.
- [X ] Meta Data / Thumbnal / FavIcon
- [] Toggle stuck when set dark mode on moble device
  Unhandled Runtime Error
  Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.
  See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error

In HTML, <main> cannot be a child of <html>.
This will cause a hydration error.

- [ ] Project Images on small devices

## Further Development (ToDo)

- [ ] Feedback form
- [ ] Add an AI Chat Assistant to the website
- [ ] Improve the Hero Section
